# rontend-mini-projects

 A collection of small front-end practice projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or PHP.
These mini projects are made to strengthen my fundamentals, experiment with new ideas, and improve my UI/UX skills.
Larger or more advanced projects are hosted in a separate repository
